For touch events, the [atom-touch-events](https://atom.io/packages/atom-touch-events) package is required. You'll have to re-enable autohide-tree-view, or reload Atom, after installing atom-touch-events for the touch events to work.\n\n## Services provided\n\nautohide-tree-view provides a service for Show, Hide, Enable and Disable actions. To consume the service, put the following in your package's `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"consumedServices\": {\n  \"autohide-tree-view\": {\n    \"versions\": {\n      // refers to the consumer method in your package's main module\n      \"^0.20.0\": \"consumeAutohideTreeViewService\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd in your package's main module, put this:\n\n```coffee\nconsumeAutohideTreeViewService: (service) ->\n  # show/hide the tree view\n  # @param delay: delay in ms before starting the animation\n  service.show(delay)\n  service.hide(delay)\n\n  # enable/disable autohide behaviour\n  service.enable()\n  service.disable()\n```\n\nAll methods return a promise that will be resolved once the tree view animation is done. It's resolved value is a boolean, indicating if the animation was finished (`true`) or cancelled (`false`). The promise is rejected if an error occurs during the animation.\n\n## Issues/suggestions\n\nPlease file issues or suggestions on the [issues page on github](https://github.com/olmokramer/autohide-tree-view/issues/new), or even better, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-autohide-tree-view/pulls)\n\n## License\n\n&copy; 2015 Olmo Kramer <br> [MIT License](LICENSE.md)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-autohide-tree-view/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/olmokramer/atom-autohide-tree-view","_id":"autohide-tree-view@0.20.2","_shasum":"77500bdca7ecd84530121b49b6090bb34b92a9f2","_resolved":"file:../d-11562-18604-mm05fa/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11562-18604-mm05fa/package.tgz"}
